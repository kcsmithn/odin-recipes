    <h1>Shepherd's Pie</h1>

    <p>The Best Classic Shepherd’s Pie – AKA Shepards Pie or Cottage Pie. Ground Beef (or lamb) with vegetables in a rich gravy, topped with cheesy mashed potatoes, and baked.</p>

    <p>So, this is how you spell it:  Shepherd’s Pie.  But, from doing a quick google search, it came to my attention that TONS of people think it’s Shepards Pie.</p>

    <h2>Irish Shepherd’s Pie</h2>

    <p>Traditional Irish Shepherd’s Pie would actually call for ground lamb.  The difference between Shepherd’s Pie and Cottage Pie is the meat.  Cottage Pie uses ground beef, while Shepherd’s Pie uses ground lamb.</p>

    <p>I called this recipe Shepherd’s Pie.  But, I wrote the recipe so that you could use ground beef or ground lamb.</p>

    <p>I typically use ground beef because it is widely available.  But, for a special occasion, like St. Patricks day, I would use ground lamb.</p>
